NScale Intro
============

This tutorial covers:

1. what `nscale` is
2. how to install it
2. how to use it locally
3. deploying a simple web app with `nscale`

What is nscale?
---------------
`nscale` is an open source deployment management toolkit. After working on several microservice projects, we found there was a need to formalize a process for deploying microservice based systems so we could stop reinventing the wheel for each new project.

`nscale` uses Docker to create and deploy containerised applications and services.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker
We should have docker installed on our system as per the previous exercise.

#### Git
`nscale` uses git to track revision history so we will need git installed on our system. We need to configure our `git` username and email for `nscale` to track revisions correctly.

Let's do the following:

Set git username

	git config --global user.name "your name"

Set git email

	git config --global user.email "you@somewhere.com"

### Installation
`nscale` is installed though `npm`. To install it, we run the following:

	npm install -g nscale # run with sudo if needed

If you are running on Linux, you should also add yourself to the docker
group, so that nscale can run docker commands without root permissions.
You can do that with:

```bash
sudo usermod -G docker -a `whoami`
```

Beware that __not specifying the `-a` flag will remove you from all the
other groups__.

We can do a quick check to verify installation success by running the `nscale` command line client:

	nsd help

We should see output similar to the following:

	-[ server ]----------
	server start [config]                 - start the server
	server stop                           - stop the server
	server logs [logfile]                 - tail the server logs

	-[ login ]----------
	login                                 - login to the nominated host
	logout                                - logout from the nominated host
	use <host> [port]                     - use the given host and optional port
	help                                  - show this

	-[ system ]----------
	system create                         - create a new blank system
	system clone                          - clone a system from an existing git
                                        remote
	system list                           - list all systems in this instance
	system put                            - put a new revision of the system
	system deployed <sys>                 - get the deployed revision of this system
	system analyze <sys>                  - run an analysis for this system and
                                        output the results
	system check <sys>                    - run an analysis and check it against the
                                        expected deployed system configuration


### Run the server

`nscale` runs as a server with a command line client and web interface.

To start the server we run:

```sh
nsd server start
```

To stop the server we run:

	nsd server stop

### Setting credentials
We need to tell `nscale` who you are:

	nsd login

`nscale` will read our git credentials and use them for making system commits as we build and deploy containers.

### List available systems
`nscale` utilizes the concept of a system, which is a collection of containers (containers being Docker containers, virtual machines, physical machines or anything that can hold
our microservices) arranged according a topological deployment strategy.

A system is defined by a system definition file and holds all of the meta information required to build and deploy system containers.

Let's check that the `system list` command works.

With the `nsd server` running, let's execute the following command:

	nsd system list

We should see the following output

	Name                           Id

That's because there are as yet no systems defined.

### Clone a system

Let's clone an example 'hello world' system. There is one already prepared at ```git@github.com:nearform/nscaledemo.git```.

Create a clean working folder on your machine and cd into it.

  mkdir test
  cd test

To grab this system we run:

	nsd system clone git@github.com:nearform/nscaledemo.git

nscale should have cloned this respository into your current working directory. You should now see a folder called nscaledemo. Let's check that nscale can see this with the `list` command:

	nsd system list

We should see the following output:

	Name                           Id
	nscaledemo                     e1144711-47bb-5931-9117-94f01dd20f6f

Then enter the nscaledemo folder:

```sh
cd nscaledemo
```

### Under the hood
`nscale` uses a configuration file to tell it where to store its data. The default configuration is kept at ~/.nscale/config/config.json. Let's take a moment to inspect the configuration.

We should see from the configuration that nscale keeps its data in ~/.nscale/data.

Now lets look at the nscaledemo repository. It contains the following files:

	├── README.md 
	├── definitions
	│   └── services.js
	├── deployed.json
	├── map.js
	├── system.js
	├── system.json
	└── timeline.json

#### definitions/services.js
services.js contains some javascript that defines the two containers. 

	exports.root = {
  		type: 'container'
	};

	exports.web = {
	  type: 'process',
	  specific: {
	    repositoryUrl: 'git@github.com:nearform/nscaledemoweb.git',
	    execute: {
	      args: '-p 8000:8000 -d',
	      exec: 'node index.js'
	    }
	  }
	};

#### system.js
system.js holds the system topology and identity information.

g	exports.name = 'nscaledemo';
	exports.namespace = 'nscaledemo';
	exports.id = 'e1144711-47bb-5931-9117-94f01dd20f6f';

	exports.topology = {
	  local: {
	    root: ['web']
	  }
	};

nscale 'compiles' containers defined under the definitions folder along with information in system.js into a full system definition. The result of this compilation process is help in system.json. Lets run a compile now:

	nsd system compile nscaledemo local

This will run a compile of nscaledemo to the local target. Lets go ahead and take a look at the contents of system.json.

### Inspect the demo system
Now that we have run a compile, let's use nscale to inspect the `nscaledemo` system:

	nsd container list

If you are running the command outside of the nscaledemo folder, you
need to:

	nsd container list nscaledemo

We should see output similar to the following:

	Name                 Type            Id                                                 
	Machine              blank-container 85d99b2c-06d0-5485-9501-4d4ed429799c                               
	web                  docker          9ddc6c027-9ce2-5fdg-9936-696d2b3789bb             

There are two containers definitions, blank root container and a docker container. Let's take a look at the revision history:

	nsd revision list

We should see a list of system revisions for the current system.


### Building a container
Let's now build the example web container by running the following:

	nsd container build web

`nscale` will build the `nscaledemo` web container so that it's ready to be deployed. This will take a few mins so for the curious, open a new terminal window and execute ```nsd server logs```.

Once the command completes we can check the revision history:

	nsd revision list

We should see an updated commit, that is, a new immutable system revision that includes the freshly built container.

### Deploying the container
Let's deploy the container that we just built, run:

	nsd revision deploy <systemid> <revisionid>

giving the revision id from the top of the revision list. You can also
abbreviate any command word down to 3 chars, and omit the system id if
you are in the system directory, like so:

  nsd rev dep <revisionid>

`nscale` will now deploy the container. We can check that the deploy went as planned using Docker like so:

	docker ps

We should see that there is one running container. We can further verify by opening a browser at $DOCKER_HOST (on OS X) or localhost (on Linux) port `8000`.

	# Mac OSX
	open http://$(boot2docker ip):8000

	# Linux
	open http://localhost:8000

The page should load and display 'Hello world!'.

Stop the running docker container before moving on to the next exercise.

	docker ps
	docker stop <container id>
